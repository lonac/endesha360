# Student Test Results and Progress Tracking

This document describes the implementation of the student test results viewing functionality that allows students to track their progress.

## Overview

Students can now view their test results and track their progress through a comprehensive dashboard that combines:
- Module progress from the Student Management Service
- Test attempt history from the Test Service
- Detailed test results with integrity monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### Student Management Service
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/student-progress/comprehensive/student/{studentId}` - Returns comprehensive progress with test results
- **Enhanced Service**: `StudentProgressService.getComprehensiveProgress()` - Combines student progress with test results
- **Update Endpoint**: `POST /api/student-progress/update-after-exam` - Updates progress after test completion
- **Feign Client**: `TestServiceClient` - Communicates with Test Service to fetch test results

#### Test Service
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/exams/results/student/{studentId}` - Returns all test results for a student
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/exams/results/{attemptId}` - Returns specific test result
- **Enhanced Service**: `TestService.getStudentTestResults()` - Fetches student's test history
- **New DTO**: `TestResultDto` - Structured test result data with integrity information

### Frontend Components

#### Enhanced Results & Progress Page
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between Progress Overview and Test History
- **Progress Overview**: Shows module progress with associated test results
- **Test History**: Detailed table view of all test attempts
- **Integrity Monitoring**: Displays tab switches, focus losses, and fullscreen exits
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges for easy identification

### Data Flow

1. **Test Completion**:
   - Student completes test in Test Service
   - Test Service calculates score and updates test attempt
   - Test Service calls Student Management Service to update progress
   - Progress is updated with score and completion status

2. **Viewing Results**:
   - Student navigates to Results & Progress page
   - Frontend fetches comprehensive progress from Student Management Service
   - Student Management Service calls Test Service for test results
   - Combined data is displayed in user-friendly format

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Progress Tracking**: Combines module progress with test results
- **Test Integrity Monitoring**: Tracks and displays integrity violations during tests
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress is automatically updated after test completion
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if services are unavailable

## API Endpoints

### Student Management Service
- `GET /api/student-progress/student/{studentId}` - Basic progress
- `GET /api/student-progress/comprehensive/student/{studentId}` - Comprehensive progress with test results
- `POST /api/student-progress/update-after-exam` - Update progress after exam

### Test Service
- `GET /api/exams/results/student/{studentId}` - Student's test results
- `GET /api/exams/results/{attemptId}` - Specific test result

## Frontend Routes
- `/results-progress` - Student results and progress dashboard

## Data Models

### TestResultDto
```java
{
  "attemptId": "string",
  "studentId": "long",
  "startedAt": "instant",
  "score": "integer",
  "totalQuestions": "integer", 
  "percentage": "double",
  "status": "string",
  "durationSeconds": "integer",
  "tabSwitches": "integer",
  "focusLosses": "integer",
  "fullscreenExits": "integer"
}
```

### StudentProgressWithResultsDto
```java
{
  "id": "long",
  "studentId": "long",
  "courseId": "long",
  "moduleName": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "score": "double",
  "updatedAt": "LocalDateTime",
  "testResults": [TestResultSummaryDto]
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Add charts and graphs for progress visualization
2. **Performance Trends**: Track improvement over time
3. **Recommendations**: Suggest areas for improvement based on test results
4. **Export Functionality**: Allow students to download their progress reports
5. **Detailed Review**: Allow students to review their answers for completed tests
